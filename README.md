## How to Run Solutions

Each topic has its own directory under `topics/` with both exercises and solutions:
## How to Run Solutions

Each topic has exercises and my solutions in separate directories:

```bash
# Navigate to any topic's solutions directory
cd topics/[topic_name]/solutions

# Run my solved code
cargo run

# Run tests to verify solutions
cargo test
